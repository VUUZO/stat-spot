## Listento

Listento is a simple application that leverages the [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api) to display your top tracks and the currently playing song. Built with TypeScript and styled using Tailwind CSS, this project provides a clean interface for me to explore my listening habits. You can see the app [live here](https://cosieslucha.vercel.app/).
